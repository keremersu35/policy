        <h1>Privacy Policy for iPlayr</h1>
        <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: October 6, 2025</p>

        <div class="highlight">
            <p><strong>Your Privacy Matters:</strong> iPlayr is committed to protecting your privacy. This app does not collect, store, transmit, or share any personal information or usage data.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>This Privacy Policy explains how iPlayr ("we," "our," or "the app") handles user information. We believe in complete transparency, and we want you to understand that your privacy is paramount to us.</p>
        <p>iPlayr is a music player application designed to provide you with a nostalgic iPod-like experience on your iOS device. The app operates entirely on your device and does not communicate with any external servers.</p>

        <h2>2. Information We DO NOT Collect</h2>
        <p>iPlayr does not collect, store, access, or transmit any of the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Personal Information:</strong> We do not collect names, email addresses, phone numbers, or any other personally identifiable information.</li>
            <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> We do not track how you use the app, which songs you play, or how often you use specific features.</li>
            <li><strong>Device Information:</strong> We do not collect device identifiers, IP addresses, or system information.</li>
            <li><strong>Location Data:</strong> We do not access or collect any location information.</li>
            <li><strong>Analytics:</strong> We do not use any analytics services or tracking tools.</li>
            <li><strong>Crash Reports:</strong> We do not collect crash reports or error logs.</li>
            <li><strong>Music Library Data:</strong> While the app accesses your music library to play songs, this information never leaves your device and is not stored or transmitted anywhere.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. How the App Works</h2>
        <p>iPlayr operates entirely locally on your device:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The app accesses your device's music library through Apple's MediaPlayer framework solely for the purpose of playing music.</li>
            <li>All app settings and preferences are stored locally on your device using iOS's standard UserDefaults system.</li>
            <li>No data is transmitted to external servers or third parties.</li>
            <li>The app does not require an internet connection to function.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Music Library Access</h2>
        <p>To function properly, iPlayr requires permission to access your music library. This permission is used exclusively to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Display your music collection within the app</li>
            <li>Play songs from your library</li>
            <li>Show album artwork and metadata</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This access is handled entirely through Apple's secure MediaPlayer framework, and no music library information is collected, stored separately, or transmitted outside of your device.</p>

        <h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>iPlayr does not integrate with any third-party services, analytics platforms, advertising networks, or data collection tools. The app is completely standalone and self-contained.</p>

        <h2>6. Data Storage</h2>
        <p>Any data stored by the app (such as user preferences, playback settings, or playlists) is stored locally on your device using iOS's standard secure storage mechanisms. This data:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Remains entirely on your device</li>
            <li>Is never transmitted to any server</li>
            <li>Is deleted when you uninstall the app</li>
            <li>Can be cleared by deleting the app from your device</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>7. Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>iPlayr does not collect any information from anyone, including children under the age of 13. The app is safe for users of all ages as it does not engage in any data collection practices.</p>

        <h2>8. Security</h2>
        <p>Since iPlayr does not collect or transmit any data, there is no risk of data breaches or unauthorized access to your information through the app. All app functionality is performed locally on your device using iOS's secure frameworks.</p>

        <h2>9. Your Rights</h2>
        <p>Since we do not collect any personal data, there is no data to access, modify, or delete. You have complete control over the app simply by using or uninstalling it from your device.</p>

        <h2>10. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>If we make any changes to this Privacy Policy, we will update the "Last Updated" date at the top of this page. We will notify users of any material changes through an app update. However, our commitment to not collecting any user data will remain unchanged.</p>

        <h2>11. Contact Us</h2>
        <p>If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy or iPlayr's privacy practices, please feel free to contact us.</p>
        <p>We take your privacy seriously and are committed to maintaining a completely privacy-respecting music player application.</p>

        <h2>12. Consent</h2>
        <p>By using iPlayr, you consent to this Privacy Policy. Given that we do not collect any data, your use of the app does not result in any data collection or processing.</p>

        <div class="highlight">
            <p><strong>Summary:</strong> iPlayr is designed with privacy as a core principle. We don't collect, store, or transmit any of your dataâ€”period. Your music, your preferences, and your listening habits stay entirely on your device, exactly where they belong.</p>
