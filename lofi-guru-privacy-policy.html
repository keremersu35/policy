    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>LoFi Guru (“we,” “our,” or “the App”) values your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your information when you use our application, which generates lofi music using <strong>Fal.ai</strong> (including the <em>cassetteai/music-generator</em> model). We also use Firebase to monitor performance, not to collect personal data for marketing or profiling.</p>

    <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>LoFi Guru itself does not collect or store personal information from users. However, limited technical data may be automatically collected for performance and stability monitoring via Firebase, such as:</p>

      <li>Crash logs and diagnostic data (e.g., device type, OS version, error messages)</li>
      <li>App usage statistics (e.g., session duration, feature interactions)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>Our app integrates third-party services. Their data practices are governed by their own policies:</p>
    <ul>

According to <a href="https://fal.ai/privacy" target="_blank">Fal.ai Privacy Policy</a>, they may collect information such as name, email, phone number (if provided), IP address, device identifiers, and analytics data through cookies or similar technologies.</li>
      <li><strong>CassetteAI</strong> (Pixl Technologies, Inc.) — Powers the music generation model. As outlined in the <a href="https://cassetteai.com/privacy" target="_blank">CassetteAI Privacy Policy</a>, they may collect identifiers (name, email, device ID), crash data (IP, OS version), and analytics information. CassetteAI also complies with child privacy laws and does not knowingly collect data from children under 13.</li>
      <li><strong>Firebase</strong> (Google LLC) — Used strictly for app analytics and crash reporting. See <a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy" target="_blank">Firebase Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. How We Use Data</h2>
    <p>Data collected by third-party services is primarily used to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Monitor and improve application performance</li>
      <li>Debug technical issues and prevent crashes</li>
      <li>Ensure stable and secure functionality of AI-generated music</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We do not sell, rent, or trade user data.</p>

    <h2>5. Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>LoFi Guru does not share personal information directly. However, technical and analytical data may be processed by Fal.ai, CassetteAI, and Firebase as part of their service delivery. Please review their individual privacy policies for detailed information.</p>
