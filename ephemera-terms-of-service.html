        <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
        <span class="date">Last Updated: February 28, 2026</span>

        <p>By downloading or using <strong>Stamp Journal</strong>, these terms will automatically apply to you &ndash;
            you should make sure therefore that you read them carefully before using the app. You are not allowed to
            copy, or modify the app, any part of the app, or our trademarks in any way.</p>

        <h2>1. Use of the App</h2>
        <p>Stamp Journal allows you to create digital stamps from photos and AI prompts to organize them in digital
            journals. You are fully responsible for the content you create (including text prompts sent to the AI) and
            the photos you import. You agree not to use the AI generation tool to create illegal, highly sensitive,
            explicit, or harmful imagery.</p>

        <h2>2. Premium Subscriptions (Stamp Journal PRO)</h2>
        <p>We offer auto-renewable subscriptions (e.g., Weekly, Monthly) granting access to premium features (unlimited
            journals, AI usage, premium textures, etc.). By subscribing, you agree to the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Payment will be charged to your Apple ID account at the confirmation of purchase.</li>
            <li>The subscription automatically renews unless it is canceled at least 24 hours before the end of the
                current period.</li>
            <li>Your account will be charged for renewal within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period.</li>
            <li>You can manage and cancel your subscriptions by going to your account settings on the App Store after
                purchase.</li>
            <li>Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when you purchase a
                subscription.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>The app does use third-party services (Apple, RevenueCat, Firebase, FAL) that declare their own Terms and
            Conditions. Our service acts as the bridge connecting your requests to the AI generation models provided by
            FAL. We do not guarantee 100% uptime of these external AI generation services.</p>

        <h2>4. Intellectual Property</h2>
        <p>The app itself, and all the trade marks, copyright, design rights (including the glassmorphism UI, 3D puncher
            models, metallic shaders), and other intellectual property rights related to it, belong to Stamp Journal and
            its developers. The artworks you create using the AI tool belong to you, but you must adhere to the terms of
            FAL's acceptable use policy regarding AI-generated art.</p>

        <h2>5. Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p>The application is provided "as is". We are not liable for any data loss regarding your customized journals.
            Because journals are saved to your device, deleting the app may result in permanent loss of your collection
            unless you have backed it up to iCloud.</p>

        <h2>6. Changes to This Agreement</h2>
        <p>We reserve the right to modify these Terms at any time. We will notify users of significant changes via the
            app. Your continued use of the app after such modifications will constitute acknowledgment and agreement of
            the modified terms.</p>

        <h2>7. Contact Information</h2>
        <p>If you have any questions or suggestions about our Terms of Service, do not hesitate to contact us at: <a
